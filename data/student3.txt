Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
Deep learning is a specific method of machine learning that incorporates neural networks. It has been a massive breakthrough in recent years.
