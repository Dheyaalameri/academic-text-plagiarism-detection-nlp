Artificial Intelligence (AI) is basically intelligence shown by machines, which is different from the natural intelligence of humans and animals. Many AI textbooks describe the field as the study of "intelligent agents". These are devices that perceive their environment and do things to improve their chances of success. People often use the term "artificial intelligence" for machines that copy "cognitive" functions like "learning" and "problem solving".
As machines get better, tasks that we thought needed "intelligence" are taken out of the AI definition. This is called the AI effect. Tesler said "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For example, optical character recognition is now just routine technology. Modern AI includes understanding human speech, playing games like chess and Go, self-driving cars, and military simulations.
